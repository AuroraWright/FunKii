This tool just allows you to download Wii contents from the Nintendo CDN and package them into .wad files. You need to compile the provided wadpacker and place it in your PATH. A title key is needed for anything except system titles (for the moment you'll need to provide a dummy title key for system titles, and the legit cetk will be downloaded and used). DLCs will be correctly handled as well.
